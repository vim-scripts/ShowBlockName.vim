Display the name of the current "block" the cursor is in in the command-line
area (i.e., with vim's echo).

A "block" is context-sensitive, (e.g., function name, variable name if in an
initialization, type name if in a typedef, etc.)

NOTE: The only languages with specific support as-is are vim scripts, Perl, and C.  Support for other languages can be added by modifying the script with appropriate search patterns.

Typical use (.vimrc):
  au CursorHold *	call ShowBlockName('quiet')

  " Show the name of the function we're in on the message line; pnuemonic [[
  map <silent> g[[	:call ShowBlockName()<CR>

  " Disable ShowBlockName (once); to prevent the CursorHold autocommand from
  " overwriting something in the command window (e.g., SyntaxAttr() output).
  map <silent> g]] :call ShowBlockName('OFF')<CR>


  " Tweak commands like [d so that they disable ShowBlockName so
  " it doesn't obliterate the output of this command.
  nnoremap [d :call ShowBlockName('[d')<CR>
  nnoremap [i :call ShowBlockName('[i')<CR>

NOTE:
	This will NOT work if the start-of-block is the first line in a file.

THIS SCRIPT USES ShowLine ( vimscript #381 )
